## Constraint 1: Offerings Uniqueness
**Description:** Offerings are unique. Multiple offerings on the same day and time slot must be offered at different locations.

**OCL Expression:**

```ocl
context Offering
inv UniqueOfferings:
    Offering.allInstances()->isUnique(o | Tuple {
        date: o.date,
        timeSlot: o.timeSlot,
        location: o.location
    })
```
**Explanation:** This invariant ensures that for all instances of `Offering`, the combination of `date`, `timeSlot`, and `location` is unique.

**Description:** Any client who is underage must necessarily be accompanied by an adult who acts as their guardian.

**OCL Expression:**

```ocl
context Client
inv UnderageClientMustHaveGuardian:

**Description:** The city associated with an offering must be one of the cities that the instructor has indicated in their availabilities.

        date: b.offering.date,
        timeSlot: b.offering.timeSlot
    })
```
**Explanation:** For each `Client`, their bookings must be unique based on the `date` and `timeSlot` of the associated `Offering`.
